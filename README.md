# MY Capstone Project - 'Do I realkly need that?!'

DIRNT?! is an app that should help users avoid impulsive purchases. The user is able to gop through 5-6 quick questions which will evaluate the pros and cons of this product. And further more the user can set a consideration time. when this time is up, the app will ask the user if he still wants do purchse it or maybe it was just a bad idea thinking 'I need that right away!'
